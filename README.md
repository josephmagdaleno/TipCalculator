# Joeys TipCalculator

#Description
Javascript application to calculate tips

#Details
This application was made for personal use.
It solves the problem everyone runs into, how much gradituity%?
One thing I learned from this project is that I am not tipping enough!
The one thing different about this application is that it has an option to split the tip% between multiple people.
